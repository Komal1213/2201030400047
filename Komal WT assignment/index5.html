    <p class="heading">The Battle Of Haldighati</p>
    <p>The battle of Haldighati was a battle fought on 18 June 1576 between the Mewar forces led by 
        Maharana Pratap, and the Mughal forces led by Man Singh I of Amber.</p>
    <p> The Rana (King) of Mewar, regarded as one of the strongest kings of the Rajput states, had fought 
        a war with the Mughals which culminated in the Siege of Chittorgarh in 1568. The siege ended with 
        the loss of a sizable portion of eastern Mewar to the Mughals.</p>
    <p>The battle of Haldighati was significant for the valour displayed by the Rajputs and the small tribe
        Bhils. Rana Pratap set an example of courage and bravery in the Haldighati battle.</p> 
    <p>It was a turning point for the Mughals as well, as it for a time halted Mughal expansion into the 
        rest of Mewar, diverting valuable military assets to the region.</p>
