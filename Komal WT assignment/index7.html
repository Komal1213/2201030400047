    <p class="heading">Quit India Movement</p>
    <p>Mumbai's Gowalia Tank Maidan also known as August Kranti Maidan is the place where the quit India movement
       was launched by Mahatma Gandhi. He along with other leaders gathered here on August 8 and 9, 1942.</p>
    <p>The movement gave the slogans 'Quit India' or 'Bharat Chodo'. Gandhi gave the slogan to the people - 'Do 
        or die'.</p>
    <p>The Quit India Resolution was passed by the Congress Working Committee on 8 August 1942 in Bombay. 
       Gandhi was named the movement's leader.</p> 
    <p>Even though the government said that independence could be granted only after the end of the war, the 
       movement drove home the point that India could not be governed without the support of the Indians.</p>

    <p>The movement placed the demand for complete independence at the top agenda of the freedom movement. 
        Public morale and anti-British sentiment were enhanced.</p>
